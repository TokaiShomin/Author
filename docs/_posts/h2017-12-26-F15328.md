Yuri, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Tragedy, Female Lead, Magic, Strong LeadI have lived a long, long time. Longer than the universe knows; longer than any star has seen or traveling light records. My memories; that is all that is left that knows that length, and that which was seen within it. Then again, that is all that ever did. When I am gone, it will be forgotten, a truth and a history lost.
