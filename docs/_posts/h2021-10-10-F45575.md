The year is 2362. Two years after the signing of the Ceres Armistice, and the cessation of open hostilities between the Earth Sphere Federation and the Jovian Confederacy, Rain and the crew of the Speak Softly, a salvage vessel plying the Jupiter System, discover the remnants of one of the many secrets of that war, and their lives are changed forever.
