This is a romance comedy satire reverse harem AU slice of life series based on all the original characters from Tales of Teleios by Asvoria K.. Clara (who was Chlorus in Tales of Teleios) was a simple girl who was offered a place to further her education in a private academy full of handsome rich influential people consist of: a prince with hairline problem, a son of a dictator, a celebrity host, a strange mafia and a villainess with daddy issue... well, you know the drill, this is another ultra cliche romance story. The writer wrote it for fun! If you get the joke. Written with the wish fulfilment plots, super overused tropes and no language quality at all. So sit back and enjoy! Weekly updates!
