Everyone knows the stories about heroes. They get reincarnated or summoned, or some other mishap occurs, and then they go on to save the land.
Julia never thought of herself as hero material. She didn’t ever even dream of being a hero.
Instead of arriving home one evening, Julia finds herself in the Abyss. Not only is she far from home, she’s also been Cursed.
